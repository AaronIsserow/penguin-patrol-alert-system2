## Project Overview

**Penguin Patrol Alert System** is a full-stack web application developed for **EEE4113F** at the University of Cape Town. It integrates real-time predator detection (via computer vision and a Raspberry Pi NoIR camera) with a two-axis pan‚Äìtilt gimbal and non-lethal deterrent actuation. Alerts are stored and displayed through a user-friendly dashboard, ensuring rapid intervention to protect the De Hoop penguin colony.

## Motion Detection

The Penguin Patrol Alert System employs an advanced real-time motion detection algorithm running on a Raspberry Pi with a NoIR camera module. This enables reliable predator detection even under challenging lighting conditions.

- **Algorithm Overview:**  
  - The system captures continuous frames from the NoIR camera and applies frame differencing to highlight regions of change between consecutive images.  
  - To reduce noise and false positives caused by environmental factors (e.g., shadows, lighting changes), a Gaussian blur filter is applied before differencing.  
  - The resulting difference image is thresholded to create a binary mask representing motion regions.  
  - Contours are extracted from this binary mask and filtered based on area and shape criteria to isolate valid moving objects.  
  - Temporal filtering tracks object persistence over multiple frames to avoid transient false detections.  
- **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi Camera Module V2 NoIR is used for its enhanced infrared sensitivity, combined with optional IR LED illumination for night-time detection.  
- **Control Integration:** Upon detection, the Python-based control script commands the pan‚Äìtilt gimbal servos via GPIO using pigpio, allowing smooth tracking of detected objects within ¬±90¬∞ range.  
- **Alerting:** Simultaneously, detection events are logged and pushed in real-time to the Supabase backend, enabling live notifications and historical analytics through the web dashboard.  
- **Configuration:** Parameters such as blur kernel size, threshold values, minimum contour area, and tracking persistence are adjustable in the `motionsense.py` file to optimize system performance under varying environmental conditions.

This comprehensive detection pipeline balances sensitivity with robustness, ensuring reliable predator tracking while minimizing false alarms to protect the penguin colony effectively.
